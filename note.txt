event distribution (x: date, y: amount, try by day first, if not ideal, by month) plot as histgram

win_prob: (bigger than 0) df and mean both (plot as time series)

README

numpy: cumsum [1, 2, 3] -> [1, 2, 5]
	cumprod [1, 2, 3] -> [1, 2, 6]
	net_value

df.rolling(window=5)    (mean, std ... )


construct event_df, take care of missing date(which is not trading day, but has announcement)

get last tading day(ricequant function)
